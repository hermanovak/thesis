# A brain lesion segmentation visualization tool 

This tool was developed as part of my thesis project to obtain a degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering at TU Delft. The development took place at MedTech West in Gothenburg, under the supervision of Rolf A Heckemann and Emilia Gryska

The code to be executed in R Studio is found in app.R. If using default data, images2.Rda and loimages3.Rda must be in the same folder.
